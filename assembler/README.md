# WAMP Assembler 
Converts assembly to binary containing machine code. 

### Notes: 
Instruction set still needs work on, to make lives easier, let's make all instructions into three characters, 
while the operands (registers, immediates, etc.) be comma separated, and be listed from left to right:

`Destination Register` > `Source Register` > `Data Register` > `Immediate values`
