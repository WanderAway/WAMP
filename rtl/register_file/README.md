# Register File 
As of right now, in an attempt to complete an instruction in a single clock cycle, I've made everything except for the writing of the register into combinational logic. 
Pipelining is making more sense at this point but I'm sure that's way more complicated than I'm currently thinking so I'll just stick with this for now.
